After new order has been received in the Rabot platform either by API or via the web order funnel, it goes through different stages depending on processing and user input:

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Open`            | The order has been received, but is not being processed yet if required data is missing (e.g. missing meter number)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Processing`      | The order is being processed, communication with other market actors (grid operators, previous supplier) is ongoing. This can take a few days up to a couple of weeks depending on the actors involved                                                                                                               |
| `Rejected`        | The order has been denied, e.g. due to a negative credit check or missing/incorrect information                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Revoked`         | The customer has revoked the order                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `PendingDelivery` | The order has been processed, and a contract confirmation has been sent to the customer, including a date for start of delivery                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Delivery`        | The supply contract is active and RABOT is delivering energy to the delivery location                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Cancelled`       | A contract termination has been received and an end of delivery date has been set. This could either be due to a customer actively sending a termination request, or because a customer has chosen a new supplier, and the supplier has communicated the termination request via the market communication processes. |
| `Unspecified`     | An unknown order state, indicating an error in the communcation with other market actors                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
