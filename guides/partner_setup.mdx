To use the API, your organization has to be set up as a partner in the RABOT platform. As part of this setup process, you receive a set of **client credentials** (client id, client password) that allow you to perform requests against the API. The client credentials also define the level of access you have, depending on the agreed use case and commercial and legal agreement in place.

<Warning>
  Make sure to always keep your client credentials safe. Do not include client credentials in client side code (smartphone app, web application), as they could easily be extracted and misused. If you think your credentials have been compromised, contact RABOT to invalidate the credentials and get a new password.
</Warning>

For development and testing purposes, the API is also available in a **test environment**, where you can create and modify data without triggering actual contract and grid operation processes.

To access the test enviroment, you have to use different hostnames for your API request.

| API                   | Test environment            | Production environment |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Authentication server | `test-auth.rabot-charge.de` | `auth.rabot-charge.de` |
| API server            | `test-api.rabot-charge.de`  | `api.rabot-charge.de`  |

Note that your client credentials are different between test and production environment. Remember to use the correct set of credentials depending on the environment.
