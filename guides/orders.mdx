title: "Managing orders via the API"

As a RABOT sales partner, the API allows you to build your own custom sales funnel for RABOT products (energy tariffs), or to integrate the price quote and order process into your own systems.

Note that, to build a sales process for RABOT energy tariffs that is compliant to the regulations, many requirements have to be fulfilled that are not part of this documentation. This documentation only covers the technical integration.

<Note>
  A `create:orders` scope is required to use this endpoint

### Create a price quote

To create a price quote for a prospect, you need to select a tariff, and provide some basic information about the prospect, such as:

- postcode of the delivery address
- expected yearly energy consumption

With this information, you can call the [offer calculation endpoint](/api-reference/tariffs/calculate_price).

This endpoint returns a response that details the different pricing components both on a monthly base and depending on the consumption, as well as the contract conditions (minimum duration, cancellation period).

### Submit the order

When a customer has accepted the offer, you can use the API to submit the customer and order details to the RABOT platform with a [create new order](/api-reference/orders/create_order) call.

For the order, you have to provide the following information (see API reference for all the details):

- a `tariffKey` to identify the requested product
- customer identification, contact details and initial password.
- delivery address and meter identification
- information about previous supplier, desired change date and expected yearly consumption
- bank details (for SEPA mandate)

If successful, the API returns a customer number and contract number, which uniquely identify the customer and order in the RABOT platform, and can be used in subsequent API calls, e.g. to check the status of the order processing.

Before submitting the order via the API, you need to ensure that customers have received all the required contract and pricing information, accepted the terms and conditions (AGB), confirmed the email address and accepted the offer.

Once the order is received by the RABOT platform, an order confirmation email will be sent out to the email address provided in the order.

### Check order status

After the order has been submitted successfully, you can use the [get order](/api-reference/orders/get_order) endpoint to follow the different processing states of the order.

See [order states](/guides/order_states) for an explanation about the different order states.

### Managing user password

If the customer email address submitted with the order does not exist in the RABOT platform yet, a new user account is automatically created. If you provide a user password in the API call, this password will be used, and the customer will be able to log into RABOT user interfaces (web portal or mobile app) using email address and password.

If no password is provided in the API call, the user account will be created with a random password, and the customer would need to go through a "forget password" flow to chose a new password.
