title: "Authentication"
---

The RABOT Partner API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication (see [RFC 7649](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749)). Using the OAuth client credentials flow, you can obtain an access token from the RABOT authentication server.

### Token request

<Info>
  replace CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET with the credentials you received from Rabot Charge. See [Partner setup](/guides/partner_setup)
</Info>

```cURL
curl -L "auth.rabot-charge.de/connect/token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "client_id={{CLIENT_ID}}" \
-d "client_secret={{CLIENT_SECRET}}" \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
-d "scope=api:partner"
```

#### Scopes

You need to specify, which scopes you want to include in the token by specifying them in `scope` parameter.

The following scopes are available:

| Scope                    | Description                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `api:partner`            | permission to access Partner API, required for all API requests                                                                       |
| `create:orders`          | permission to create orders                                                                                                           |
| `role:finance-reporting` | permission to access customer and contract data, limited to finance reporting related information                                     |
| `role:customer-support`  | permission to access customer and contract data, limited to customer support related information (includes `role: finance-reporting`) |
| `role:application`       | permission to access all customer and contract data (includes `role: finance-reporting` and `role:customer-support` )                 |

<Note>
  To use scopes, you need to have them assigned to your API client by RABOT administrators. If you feel you should have a scope, that you don't have, please contact our B2B support team.
</Note>

### Token response

If successful, the authentication server responds with a HTTP/200 status code, and the response body contains a structure with the access token

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJS....QnkY36d_ac",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3599
}
```

In all requests to the partner API, include the access token as **Bearer token** in the HTTP authorization header:

```cURL Example API request
curl -L "https://api.rabot-charge.de/partners/v1/tariffs" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJS....QnkY36d_ac"
```

<Note>
  Note that the token only has a limited life time; when the life time has expired, you will need to request a new token from the authentication server.
