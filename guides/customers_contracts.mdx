title: "Customers and Contracts"
---

The Partner API can provide access to customer and contract data. Depending on the partnership scope and agreed data privacy policies, your API client will have a certain access scope assigned (see [Scopes](/guides/access#scopes)), which controls the visibility of customer and contract information.

If your application does not have full customer data access by default, you can always use the customer linking process described below to ask the user to grant full data access to your application.

## Customer linking process

An end user can grant your application access to their data by an approval process similar to the OAuth access flow. This involves the following steps:

- call [create customer link](/api-reference/customers/create_customer_linking) to receive an `authorizationUrl` link.
- send the user to this link in a Web view.
- The user will be asked to log in using the credentials they used when creating their energy supply contract.

- After login, the user will be asked to grant your application access to their personal and contract related data stored on the Rabot platform.

  ![Customer Linking Authorize Pn](/images/customer-linking-authorize.png)
- When the user approves, the web view will be redirected to the webpage defined by the `successUrl` parameter in the [create customer link](/api-reference/customers/create_customer_linking) call, and you will be able to access the users data via the API.

<Note>
Note that the link returned by the API only has a limited validity of 10 minutes. If an end user tries to login using the link after the 10 minutes have expired, the login will fail, and you will have to create a new link again to re-start the process.
</Note>

### Managing user reference Ids

The API offers different ways for you to match customer data in the RABOT platform with the data in your own platform.

1. You can add a parameter `externalId` to the [create customer link](/api-reference/customers/create_customer_linking) call. This information is then stored with the customer data in the RABOT platform, and returned as part of the customer data in the [list customers](/api-reference/customers/list_customers) endpoint.
2. In addition, when the user is redirected after granting your application access to their data, the `successUrl` link is extended with a query parameter `customerNo` that will contain the unique customer number of this customer in the RABOT platform.

## Contract information

Via the API, you can also get access to data about the [indidvidual contracts of a customer](/api-reference/customers/list_contracts). Note that a single customer can have multiple contracts.

<Note>
Your application needs `role:application`, `role:customer-support` or `role: finance-reporting` scope to access contract information.
</Note>

Every contract initially starts as an order, received either via the web funnel or the API (see [Managing orders](/guides/orders)). Only after the order has been confirmed, and an order confirmation has been sent out to the user, is the order changed to a contract, and visible via the respective endpoint in the API.

## Contract metrics

The [contract metrics endpoint](/api-reference/customers/get_contract_metrics) provides access to pricing and consumption information related to a specific contract. This can be actual recorded data (e.g. consumption values as reported by a Smart Meter) or forecasted data (e.g. consumption data for SLP customers, or day-ahead price energy pricing).

<Note>
Your application needs `role:application` scope to access contract metrics.
</Note>

### MetricType

You can select the type of information that you want to retrieve by specifying the appropriate `MetricType`:

| MetricType     | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Consumption`  | The energy consumed during the selected period (in kWh). Can be either measured or estimated.                                                                                            |
| `WorkingPrice` | The estimated average working price (EUR/kWh) in the selected period, including all fees and taxes.                                                                                      |
| `TotalCost`    | The total energy cost in the selected period, including all fees and taxes. If the selected period is smaller than a month, the applicable monthly fees will be pro-rated to the period. |
| `Saving`       | The monetary savings (in EUR) in the selected period, compared to the local default supplier's tariff pricing.                                                                           |
| `Co2Saving`    | The savings in carbon emissions, commpared to the german energy grid mix.                                                                                                                |

<Info>
Note that for `WorkingPrice` and `TotalCost` metrics, the values returned by this API endpoint might not match the amounts reflected on the customers invoice.\
This is due to the fact that some price conditions or discounts are only calculated on a monthly level. For example a working price cap is only applied when creating the monthly invoice, so the API might return a higher monthly average working price than what is shown on the invoice.
</Info>

### ValueType

You can use the `ValueType` request parameter to define if you want to only receive recorded data or forecasted data, or both:

| ValueType  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Actual`   | return only data based on measurements, e.g. energy consumption reported by the DSO                                                                                                                                          |
| `Forecast` | return only data based on estimations, e.g. consumption estimated based on standard load profiles (SLP), not confirmed by actual meter reading yet                                                                           |
| `Dynamic`  | return either actual or forecasted data for the whole period, but not mixed                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Combined` | return either actual or forecasted data. E.g. when querying data for a month on daily level, for some days the API might returned actual data, while for other days might return forecasted data, based on data availability |

### Periods and Intervals

The API allows to retrieve data in different granularity, from to 15 minute intervals, up to aggregation on monthly or yearly level. Use the `interval` parameter to select the aggregation level.
To limit the size of the result set, depening on the selected `interval`, you can only query a limited time period:

| interval         | maximum period |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| `QuarteryHourly` | 1 day          |
| `Hourly`         | 3 days         |
| `Daily`          | 2 months       |
| `Weekly`         | 1 year         |
| `Monthly`        | 15 years       |
| `Yearly`         | 50 years       |

If you try to request a longer period, the API will return an `HTTP 400` error.

### Example - 15-min consumption for Smart Meter

For contracts that are linked to a Smart Meter, the RABOT platform typically receives the measured consumption values in 15 minutes intervals on the following day. You can use the API to retrieve this information e.g. to display a detailed consumption graph the the user.

```shell Request
curl -L "https://api.rabot-charge.de/partner/v1/customers/87678631/contracts/26765215/metrics?period.from=2025-03-01&period.to=2025-03-02&interval=QuarterHourly&metricType=Consumption&valueType=Actual" \

### Example - Daily energy cost

You can easily retrieve the daily energy cost for any contract using the metrics API endpoint:

```shell Request
curl -L "https://api.rabot-charge.de/partner/v1/customers/87678631/contracts/26765215/metrics?period.from=2025-03-01&period.to=2025-04-01&interval=Daily&metricType=TotalCost&valueType=Combined" \
