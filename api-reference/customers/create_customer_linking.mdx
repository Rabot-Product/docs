This endpoint allows you to start the customer linking process, which is used to request authorization from a customer to access their customer and contract data in the RABOT platform. See the [guide](/guides/customers_contracts#customer-linking-process) for more details.

After the customer approves the request, you can access all customer and contract data via the API, until the access is revoked, either by the customer support team, or by using the API endpoint [delete customer link](/api-reference/delete_customer_linking).
