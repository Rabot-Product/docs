You can retrieve the list of customers using this endpoint, depending on you partner setup and data access levels. See [Customers and Contracts](/guides/customers_contracts) for more information on access levels and customer linking. 

By default, the API returns only the first 10 records. Use `offset` and `limit` request parameters for [paging](/guides/pagination).
