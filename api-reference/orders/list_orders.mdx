You can use this endpoint to retrieve a list of all orders that were submitted either through the API or the web funnel, and to follow the different processing states of the orders. See [order states](/guides/order_states) for an explanation about the different order states.

By default, the API returns only the first 10 records. Use `offset` and `limit` request parameters for [paging](/guides/pagination).

You can also use the `filter.customerNumber` request parameter to retrieve the list of orders for one specific customer.
