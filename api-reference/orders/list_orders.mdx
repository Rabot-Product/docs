You can use this endpoint to retrieve a list of all orders that were submitted either through the API or the web funnel, and to follow the different processing states of the orders.

By default, the API returns only the first 10 records. Use `offset` and `limit` request parameters for [paging](/guides/pagination). 

You can also use the `filter.customerNumber` request parameter to retrieve the list of orders for one specific customer.

An order can have one of the following states:

| Order status      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Open`            | The order has been received, but is not being processed yet if required data is missing (e.g. missing meter number)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Processing`      | The order is being processed, communication with other market actors (grid operators, previous supplier) is ongoing. This can take a few days up to a couple of weeks depending on the actors involved                                                                                                               |
| `Rejected`        | The order has been denied, e.g. due to a negative credit check                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Revoked`         | The customer has revoked the order                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `PendingDelivery` | The order has been processed, and a contract confirmation has been sent to the customer, including a date for start of delivery                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Delivery`        | The supply contract is active and RABOT is delivering energy to the delivery location                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Cancelled`       | A contract termination has been received and an end of delivery date has been set. This could either be due to a customer actively sending a termination request, or because a customer has chosen a new supplier, and the supplier has communicated the termination request via the market communication processes. |
| `Unspecified`     | An unknown order state, indicating an error in the communcation with other market actors                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
